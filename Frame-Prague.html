				<div class= "description">The beautiful city of Czech Republic - Prague looks beautiful on Christmas holidays. It is among the most picturesque Christmas destinations of the world. You can go for wander on the historic Nerudova Street in Mala Strana and capture the views of the city’s Baroque and Gothic architecture. Watch an opera and enjoy ballet at the State Opera or National Theater. Also visit the holiday markets of Wenceslas Square and Old Town Square. Christmas is absolute fun here.</div>
				<div class= "description">Prague, where glorious medieval and baroque structures become accessorised with fairy lights, market stalls and, for the optimum photos, snow. Nor is this a city where Christmas seems only to be celebrated by tourists: the locals are as nuts about Christmas as the British and embrace its local traditions with genuine joy. For the most liberal doses of festive spirit, stay in the Czech capital’s historic core, close to the focal Old Town Square, and tick off as many as possible of the best things to do in Prague at Christmas.</div>
