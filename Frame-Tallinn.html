				<div class= "description">The Estonian capital is known for its wonderful Christmas spirit, with its medieval old town dusted in snow and lanterns lit after dark, providing a glow to the cobblestone streets. The world’s first Christmas tree was erected here in 1441 – and today, Tallin’s holiday traditions still include the legendary tree on Town Hall Square. The famous tree is surrounded by little huts selling their wares, and you’ll also find a number of handicraft specialists hard at work, along with snow sculptures, Estonian food and drink, and a mini-zoo. An international Christmas market, an outdoor ice rink, and the Estonian Open Air Museum‘s elaborate Christmas Village are all mainstays of the holiday season too.</div>
				<div class= "description">From the end of November, visitors can come and make wishes under the lush Christmas tree towering over Town Hall Square. December brings high spirits, bright lights, and a festive mood to Tallinn's churches, shops, and city streets.</div>
