				<div class= "description">Medieval Bruges is stunning all year round, but it truly comes alive in winter with Winter Glow. From the end of November until the beginning of January, the city transforms into a winter wonderland with cozy Christmas villages taking over three of the city’s squares, a light trail, an ice-skating rink, and decorations throughout the city. Plus, for 16 days during Winter Glow, the city limits traffic on the main shopping streets and offers free public transportation.</div>
			    	<div class= "description">Bruges is a great place to enjoy the festive season with its delicious food and drinks. During Christmas, the city is filled with stalls selling Belgian chocolates, waffles, mulled wine, and other traditional treats. It’s a perfect time to indulge in the local cuisine and warm up with a hot drink while exploring the beautiful Christmas markets.</div>
