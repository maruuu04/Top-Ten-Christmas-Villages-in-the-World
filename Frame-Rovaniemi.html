				<div class= "description">Rovaniemi in Lapland, Finland, may be the best place on earth to celebrate Christmas. Located just north of the Arctic Circle, Finns argue that it makes a much likelier home for Santa than even the North Pole. Here, children can make cookies with Mrs. Claus and even enroll in Elf School. Other highlights during this time of year include husky-dog rides, tobogganing in the deep, pristine snow, and viewing the Northern Lights. If you want an especially frosty experience, stay at the Arctic SnowHotel, constructed entirely of snow and ice, though it does come with hot tubs and saunas to offset the frozen temperatures.</div>
				<div class= "description">Rovaniemi is the Official Hometown of Santa Claus, and the city’s most famous resident can be visited all year round in Santa Claus Village. The village is situated right on the Arctic Circle, just minutes away from Rovaniemi centre. Santa Claus Village is a must see attraction that draws more than 500 000 annual visitors from all around the world.</div>
				<div class= "description">Santa Claus Village is full of original Christmas charm, for example the Santa Claus Main Post Office. It’s also the home of reindeer and huskies and other lovely creatures. A leisurely stroll through the beautifully lit and decorated Santa Claus Village square while Christmas carols are playing, will surely bring a smile to your face and guarantee that the Christmas spirit will take over. Wander through the alleys to look and admire, stop at the restaurants and cafes serving local delicacies or stop by the boutiques to admire Finnish design and handicrafts.</div>
